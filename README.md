# ipsymcon-phpmodule
PHPModules for Symcon V4+

This is a Library of PHP Modules for the home automation software "Symcon" 

### Requirements:
* Symcon (https://www.symcon.de/en/) Version 4.0+

### Modules provides in this library:

#### FHZDummy
Splitter Module for interfacing Busware CUN/CUL-Adapter to standard FHT/HMS and FS20 Devices
This module is deprecated from April 2016 in favor of CUL module

#### Weather Device
Generic Device module to present weather data

Prefix: WSD_

#### Energy Device
Generic Device module to present energy data

Prefix: END_

#### Switch Device
Generic Device module to present weather data

Prefix: SWD_

Public Functions:

forward data to splitter only, real actor control will need a Splitter with matching capabilities like AVMAHA or CUL

* SWD_SwitchMode($id,$state): set the switch to the desired state
* SWD_SetIntensity($id,$percent): Dim to the given level

#### WS300PC
Splittermodul for reading ELV WS300PC Datalogger. The Logger will be accessed via serial port.

Supported Devices:

The logger supports 8 external T/H WS300 Series Sensor (S300TH,PS50), one KS300 Kombisensor (T/H, Wind, Rain)
and the internal Indoor Sensor (T/H, Pressure, Forecast(Willi) Indicator).

Data Handling: The Data will be presented as Weather Device instances

Prefix: WS300PC_

 Public Functions:
* WS300PC_ReadCurrentRecord($id): read current sensor status, returns csv fragment. Is empty, an error occured
* WS300PC_ReadNextRecord($id): Read next history record, returns csv fragment. If empty, is error or no more records are available
Reading of all historic data at once in a loop will consume a lot of time and will usually exceed PHP max_execution_time.
* WS300PC_WriteConfig($id): write internal configuration record. this will include the properties
        RainPerCount, Altitude and RecordInterval. After executing the Logger will go in Resync for 10min
* WS300PC_GetVersion($id): Query and returns Logger firmware version

#### WDE1
Splittermodul for reading ELV WDE1 Datalogger.  The Logger will be accessed via serial port.

Supported Devices:
The Logger supports 8 external T/H WS300 Series Sensor (T/H WS300Sensor (S300TH,PS50)) and one KS300 Kombisensor (T/H, Wind, Rain).

Data Handling: The Data will be presented as Weather Device instances

Prefix: WDE1_

#### FS20WUE
Splittermodul for reading ELV FS20WUE Receiver.  The Receiver will be accessed via serial port.

Supported Devices:

* Weather: The Receiver supports 8 external T/H WS300 Series Sensor (T/H WS300Sensor (S300TH,PS50)) and one KS300 Kombisensor (T/H, Wind, Rain).
* FS20: reading of ELV FS20 telegrams for Switch devices, but cannot control such device.

Data Handling:
* Weather: The Data will be presented as Weather Device instances
* FS20: The Data will be presented as Switch instances. FS20 codes will be transformed

Prefix: WUE_

#### AVMAHA

AVM AHA-API IPSymcon PHP Splitter Module Class

read AVM AHA Smarthome Services from Fritz!OS (Ftritz!Box etc.)

supported Devices: 
* Fritz Powerline 546E
* Fritz Dect200(need FritzOS6.20+ for Temperature), 
* Repeater 100 (need FritzOS6.50+)

Data Handling:
* Power measures will be displayed in an Energey Device instance
* Temperature mesures will be displayed in a Weather Sensor Device instance
* Switch status will be displayed in a Switch Device instance. Changes on the status will be transmitted to the connected actor

Prefix: AHA_

#### TE923
Splitter for TE923 based weather stations (TFA Nexus,Ventus 831, Mebus 923 etc) using TE923con output
 * This requires a running webservice providing output from <a href="http://te923.fukz.org/">te923con</a> binary.
 The following simple get_data.cgi script is sufficient
 <pre>
 #!/bin/bash
 TE923=/usr/bin/te923con
 #header content type end empty line
 echo "Content-type: text/plain"
 echo
 #end header

 #parameter
 PARAM="$QUERY_STRING" #oder $1
 #run
 if [ -x $TE923 ]; then
 #binary must be placed into same dir
 #this runs only if apache user www-data is member of group plugdev
 #and udev rule is added
   case "$PARAM" in
         data) $TE923 -i 'i';;
         status)  $TE923 -s -i 'i';;
         debug)  $TE923 -D -i 'i';;
         version)  $TE923 -v;;
   esac
 fi
 </pre>

Supported Devices:
5 external Temp/Hum Sensors(1-5), Rain, Wind, UV(not seen yet) and the internal indoor Sensor

Data Handling: The Data will be presented as Weather Device instances

Prefix: TE923_

####NUT
Splittermodul to query a NUT daemon for attached UPS/USV

supported Devices:
Any via NUT accessible UPS/USV.

Data Handling:
The Data will be presented as Energy Device instances
  The DeviceID should be supplied via ups.serial field. The Status Variable refers to the ups.status field.
  For explanation see
 http://networkupstools.org/documentation.html

Prefix: NUT_

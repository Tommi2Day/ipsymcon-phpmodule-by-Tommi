### CUL

CUL IPSymcon PHP Splitter Module Class

receives Data from a CULFW driven tranceiver gadget like Busware
These devices receives and decodes a lot of common smarthome protocols used by ELV Sensors and devices
supported Receivers may be connect to a serial port or client socket instance. You must create such one for
your CUL instance as parent for yourself

##### supported Devices:
* Receivers: CUL,CUN,CUNO,COC

##### decoded Protocols

 * ELV EM1000: Energy Messures EM-WZ, EM-GZ and EMEM
 * ELV FS20: Any TFK and Switch actor. Dimmer are implemented, but because lack of such device untested
 * ELV HMS: HMS100T(also used as Emulation for connected 1Wire DS1820 Sensors), HMS100TF,HMS100-TFK ...
 * ELV WS300: S300TH,PS50,KS300 Weather Sensors
 * ELV FHT: TFK  Window opening Sensor only. FHT Heating Controls like FHT80b are not implemented!
 * ELV ESA: some of the Energy Sensors. see source code. Untested!

##### Data Handling:

* Temperature mesures will be displayed in a Weather Sensor Device instance
* Switch status will be displayed in a Switch Device instance. Changes on the status will be transmitted to the connected actor

##### Actions:
 * Switching of FS20 Devices.
 Changes of the status variable will be transmitted to the connected actor

##### Prefix: CUL_

##### IPS Device module learning

Its important for the proper creation of IPS devices these must be received from the CUx Splitter
instead of manually created. Only this ensures a set of valid parameters. As example a FS20 dimming device must 
be created by receiving a dimming command apply the dimming functions, otherwise it will left as a switch.
You may use your remote control or a learning procedure for this. as an alternative, you may create a valid CUL
response string and send this manually to the CUL splitter. This procedure is described in this forum entry 
https://www.symcon.de/forum/threads/31352-neue-PHP-Module-als-Ersatz-meiner-Delphi-Module?p=303129#post303129 (in german)

see http://culfw.de/commandref.html for valid CUL response strings


### OWNet

### XS1

Splittermodule to access Ezcontrol XS1 Homeautomation Receiver/Controler

<span style="color:red">
This module is deprecated/unsupported as of 2017. I dont have this anymore.
</span>

##### Supportet Devices:
* XS1 may receive and control up to 128 Sensors metrics and 64 actors.
Because lack of availablility, not all Actors and Sensors types are implemented. See sources.

##### Data Handling:
Data will be quieried via http JSON API. Unfortunately, the API will hide the physical device typ
by mapping to internal generixc types. So far as possible we map these types to our own system.
* Power Consumtion Sensors will be mapped to Energy Devices
* Environment Measures will be presented as Weather Devices
* Alarming Sensors and all Actors will be presented as Switch Devices


Actions (if supported by the physical device)
 * Switching(On/Off) of attached actors.
 Changes of the status variable will be transmitted to the connected actor

##### Prefix: XS1_

For a complete XS1 description see vendor documentation at http://www.ezcontrol.de/content/view/36/28/ (german)

### MQTTPUB

IOModule to publish IPS Variable updates to an MQTT brocker

The module allows subscriptions of IPS Variable update messages and forwards this as json record to 
a MQTT broker. An external client may subscribe to these broker messages and proceed further 

##### Prefix: MQTTPUB_

##### Public Functions:
* MQTTPUP_Publish($id,$varid): trigger immediately publishing variable $varid to the broker 
* MQTTPUB_Subscribe($id,$varid): Subscribes VM_UPDATE messages for variable $varid on IPS Messageloop
* MQTTPUB_UnSubscribe($id,$varid): UnSubscribes VM_UPDATE messages for variable $varid from IPS Messageloop
* MQTTPUB_Subscribe_All($id,$objectid,$ident=null): Subscribes all variable IDs below $objectid to IPS Messageloop,
optionally only thus equal which supplied ident
* MQTTPUB_UnSubscribe_ALL($id,$objectid,$ident=null): UnSubscribes all variable IDs below $objectid from IPS Messageloop,
optionally only thus equal which supplied ident 

##### MQTT Topic:
The topic may be configured with config dialog window. You may set template variables within definition
 ```
 IPS/status/%varid%/%varident%/%path%
 ```
will result in
```
IPS/status/42440/Watt/APCUPSD_Devices/Back-UPS_RS_900G/Watt
```
##### Payload:
Payload is a Json string with the following components:
* Path: IPS tree of names from root to the variable
* TS: Unix Timestamp message received in MQTTPUB module
* UTF8Value: stringyfied actual value of variable
* VariableChanged: VariableChange Field of variable object
* VariableIdent: Ident of variable
* VariableType: VariableType Field of variable object
* VariableUpdated: VariableUpdated Field of variable object
```
{'Path': 'APCUPSD Devices/Back-UPS RS 900G/Watt',
 'TS': 1477132802,
 'UTF8Value': '124',
 'VariableChanged': 1477132502,
 'VariableID': 42440,
 'VariableIdent': 'Watt',
 'VariableType': 2,
 'VariableUpdated': 1477132802}
 ```
##### Sample consumer script
you can retrieve the published data from MQTT with simple scripts. A sample python script 
[ips_mqtt2db.py](https://github.com/Tommi2Day/ipsymcon-phpmodule-by-Tommi/blob/4.2/MQTTPUB/ips_mqtt2db.py) 
demonstrates how to write the payload into a mysql database

How to use:
 * create mysql account and database.
 * Grant "Create table, Insert,update,delete,index " or simple "All" on <database>
 * check if you can connect
 * create a configuration file in YAML format somewhere with the needed credentials and adjust the values.
 
   ```
    mysql:
        host: localhost
        user: ips
        passwd: secret
        db: ips
    mqtt:
        host: localhost
        port: 1883
        topic: IPS/status/#
   ```
   
 * install required additional pip libraries:
  ```
  paho_mqtt
  MySQL-python
  PyYAML
  ```

 * now call the script
   ```
    python ips_mqtt2db.py <configfilename>
   ```
   or if the configfile is named ips_mqtt2db.yml and in the same directory
   ```
   python ips_mqtt2db.py
   ```
